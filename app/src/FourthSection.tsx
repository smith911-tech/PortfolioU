          Hi, I'm Williams Joseph.
          <br />A Frontend developer based in Abuja, Nigeria, I specialize in
          creating Responsive Websites that are user friendly that capture my
          client or employer's brand. With over 1yr+ of experience in the
          industry, I've worked with a diverse range of Developers, On different
          Types of project and i've created alot of personal projects. I became
          fascinated with how technology can be used to solve problems and
          improve people's lives. This led me to take a few computer science
          courses, and I soon realized that programming was my true passion.
